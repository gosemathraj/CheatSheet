Reactive Programming
Event based asynchronous programming.Everything is a asynchronous data stream which can be observed
Data Stream can be created out of any event like variable changes,click events, http calls, errors etc.
Every code runs on its own thread.

Rx (Reactive Extensions or ReactiveX) --> Library that follows Reactive principles
RxJava (Reactive Extension library from "Netflix")
RxAndroid (Rx library specific to Android Platform )

Schedulers : Schedulers are responsible for performing operations of observable on different threads.
Schedulers decide on which thread, operation is going to be performed (Main thread or Background Thread)

Types of Schedulers :

*** IO - 
	For IO related stuff like networks requests, file System operations.IO Scheduler is backed by "Thread Pool"
	"Thread Pool" --> Group of worker threads waiting for job and can be reused many times.
	IO scheduler starts with one thread which can be reused if not it spawns other thread.
	Imp -->> Unused Threads are automatically killed after 60 seconds of inactivity.

*** Computation -
	Similar to IO Scheduler but the number of threads it can spawn is limited.
	Uses Thread Pool.
	Number of threads that can be used == Number of cores present in the system.Good for small calculations and for quick operations.

*** NewThread -
	Creates New Thread for every Observables.It does not uses Thread Pool.

*** Single -
	Single scheduler contains only Single Thread.All the observables are run on the same thread.
	No spawning of other threads.
	For sequential operations.

*** Immediate -
	This scheduler starts the task on the Main Thread.It blocks the thread (It is deprecated and removed)

*** Trampoline -
	This scheduler runs the code on the current thread that can also be the Main Thread.
	So if a code is running on Main Thread then Trampoline scheduler adds the task to the queue of the Main Thread.
	It blocks the Main Thread.
	It is similar to Immediate Scheduler except Immediate scheduler adds the task immediately but Trampoline waits for the current task to complete

*** Executor Scheduler -
	It is Custom IO Scheduler (We can customize its configuration)
	We can create a custom pool of threads where we can specify its size.

*** Android Scheduler -
	It is specific to android (Part of RxAndroid)
	It is used to bring back the execution to Main Thread so that UI changes can be made.
	Used with ObserveOn(AndroidSchedulers.mainThread())

OPERATORS :- Operates on Observables and returns Observables

Operators that create New Observables (10)
Create --> 
Defer -->
Empty Never Throw --> 
From -->
Interval 
Just
Range
Repeat
Start
Timer

SubscribeOn() --> Specifies a scheduler which decides where the task is going to be executed .Which thread to emit items on
ObserveOn()	  --> Scheduler decides where task is to done. So the result are also passed to same thread.To get results on other thread Use ObserveOn


Operators that Transforms Observables (6)
Buffer --> Groups items emitted by observables into bundles and then emits them.Instead of emitting single item it emits bundles
FlatMap --> Transforms items emitted by an observable into observables and then flattens the emissions from those into Single Observable
GroubBy --> Divides observable into observables that contains items grouped by a function and then the individual observables emits items having same key 
Map --> 
Scan
